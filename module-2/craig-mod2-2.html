	<h1>James "Clay" Craig</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p class="intro">
		Hello Internet, I’m James Craig but you may call me Clay. I’m an Entertainment Specialist at Walmart and also a student majoring in Computer Information Systems at Bellevue University. I enjoy scouring the internet for random entertainment, music, and gaming articles in my free time. I also play a few games in my free time and socialize online.
	</p>

	<p>
		As a teenager, I dabbled in web page editing on websites like Neopets and Myspace. After graduation, I got a job for a tax service company and learned some basics of SLS (Second Life’s scripting language). After my first job, I started working in wireless sales for companies such as Walmart, as well as AT&T and Verizon Wireless retailers. Now I’ve worked in wireless and electronics retail sales for more than a decade I have realized how much more I am capable of. All of the fears and doubts of massing debt with nothing to show for it from trying to obtain a college degree went away when I learned about Walmart’s partnership with Guild Education.

	<p>
		I’m driven by my excitement for this technology-driven world that I’ve grown up in. I daily share my passion and expertise with technology with others both personally and professionally. I believe by sharing my love and knowledge for tech with others I can help make their lives better. I’m also driven by creating a more inclusive workplace. As a member of the LGBT community, I know what it can feel like to be left out and I do my best to reach out and stand up for them when needed. Bringing people from all backgrounds and lifestyles is the best way to drive our world and technology forward.
	</p>

	<p>
		I decided to start this webpage to share with the world my excitement and knowledge of technology. I hope that my experience with technology and the retail environment will prove beneficial for those looking to learn or be inspired. I also want to advocate for adult learners to show them that they are capable of way more than they think they are. <span class="sentence">I hope my journey as an adult learner will inspire others to put the effort in and develop themselves to help create a brighter tomorrow. </span>

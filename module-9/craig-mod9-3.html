	<h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>
	<p>
		Growing up as a child our family owned many pets at one point we had a pet <span id="pet">_______</span> and 13 
		dogs. We had a Beagle and a <span id="dog">_______ _______</span> that would frequently stay inside but were 
		allowed to free roam around our neighborhood. Our Cocker Spaniel would often believe that 
		he was a person he would treat the other dogs rudely and loved to sit in a chair at the 
		dinner table with us as a family. 
	</p>

	<p>
		We lived next to our <span id ="fam">_______</span> who ran a country store and had a garden behind 
		their house. I remember being a kid and going to the store and getting snacks as well as 
		sitting on top of a pile of watermelons on the back of a truck to keep them from flying 
		off. My grandparents also had hogs next to us which would often roam in their pen which 
		ran right next to our house. 
	</p>

	<p>
		We had an uncle who kept <span id ="uncle">_______</span> and pet goats while growing up. Our other neighbor had 
		horses and we'd often see them in the fields and sometimes they would come right next to 
		our fence and just hang out. We lived across from our cousins who we'd regularly spend time
		 roaming the land our grandparents owned behind our house.
